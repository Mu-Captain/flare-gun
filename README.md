# flare-gun
3D Print a flare gun.

This is a group of .scad files, to make the worlds most awesome airsoft gun.  Just kidding. ;)
My wife convinced me that printable guns that go through metal detecters are probably not the best idea.
So I abandon this project, but it does make a cool toy.

1.  You use rubber bands for everything that moves.
2.  You can zip tie the end caps to hold everything together.
3.  A hole puncher and a strip of caps is awesome.
